## Usage

### Basic Example
Capture audio with voice activity detection and save it to a file:

```python
from live_audio_capture import LiveAudioCapture

# Initialize the audio capture
capture = LiveAudioCapture(
    sampling_rate=16000,  # Sample rate in Hz
    chunk_duration=0.1,   # Duration of each audio chunk in seconds
    enable_noise_canceling=True,  # Enable noise reduction
    aggressiveness=2,     # VAD aggressiveness level (0-3)
)

# Start recording with VAD
capture.listen_and_record_with_vad(
    output_file="output.wav",  # Save the recording to this file
    silence_duration=2.0,      # Stop recording after 2 seconds of silence
    format="wav",              # Output format
)

# Stop the capture
capture.stop()
```

### Real-Time Visualization
Visualize audio in real-time:

```python
from live_audio_capture import LiveAudioCapture, AudioVisualizer

# Initialize the audio capture
capture = LiveAudioCapture(sampling_rate=44100, chunk_duration=0.1)

# Initialize the audio visualizer
visualizer = AudioVisualizer(sampling_rate=44100, chunk_duration=0.1)

# Stream audio and visualize it
for audio_chunk in capture.stream_audio():
    visualizer.add_audio_chunk(audio_chunk)
```

### Advanced Example
Use all available parameters for maximum customization:

```python
from live_audio_capture import LiveAudioCapture

# Initialize the audio capture with all parameters
capture = LiveAudioCapture(
    sampling_rate=16000,
    chunk_duration=0.1,
    audio_format="f32le",
    channels=1,
    aggressiveness=3,
    enable_beep=True,
    enable_noise_canceling=True,
    low_pass_cutoff=7500.0,
    stationary_noise_reduction=True,
    prop_decrease=1.0,
    n_std_thresh_stationary=1.5,
    n_jobs=1,
    use_torch=False,
    device="cpu",
    calibration_duration=2.0,
    use_adaptive_threshold=True,
)

# Start recording with VAD
capture.listen_and_record_with_vad(
    output_file="output.wav",
    silence_duration=2.0,
    format="wav",
)

# Stop the capture
capture.stop()
```

## Recommendations
1. **Use Threading for Real-Time Listening**: It is highly recommended to use threading for real-time audio listening. This allows you to easily stop the audio capture in any script using the `.stop()` method without blocking the main program.
2. **Use a High-Quality Microphone**: For best results, use a microphone with good noise cancellation.
3. **Adjust VAD Aggressiveness**: Higher aggressiveness levels may reduce false positives but can also miss softer speech.
4. **Enable Noise Reduction**: If you're working in a noisy environment, enable noise reduction for cleaner audio.
5. **Test on Your Platform**: Test the package on your target platform to ensure compatibility.

## Technical Details

### Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
The VAD system uses an energy-based approach with adaptive thresholding. It calculates the energy of each audio chunk and compares it to a dynamically adjusted threshold. Hysteresis is applied to avoid rapid toggling between speech and silence states.

### Noise Reduction
The `noisereduce` package is used for noise reduction. It employs spectral gating techniques to remove background noise while preserving speech. You can choose between stationary and non-stationary noise reduction, and even use PyTorch for GPU-accelerated processing.

### Real-Time Visualization
The visualization module provides insights into:
- **Waveform**: The amplitude of the audio signal over time.
- **Frequency Spectrum**: The distribution of frequencies in the audio signal.
- **Spectrogram**: A visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies over time.
- **Volume Meter**: Real-time volume levels.
- **Volume History**: A history of volume levels over time.
